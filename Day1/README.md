# Day 1 – Basic RTL Design and Simulation


## ✅ Objective
- To design and verify a simple RTL circuit using Verilog.
- Write a testbench to apply input vectors.
- Simulate using **iverilog** and visualize results with **GTKWave**.
  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
⦁iVerilog → Open-source Verilog compiler and simulator, used to compile and run Verilog design files.

iVerilog → For compiling and simulating Verilog code.


⦁GTKWave → Waveform viewer to analyze simulation output signals visually (timing diagrams).

GTKWave → For viewing waveforms generated by simulation.


⦁Yosys → Open-source framework for RTL synthesis, mainly used to synthesize Verilog code into a gate-level netlist.

Yosys → For performing synthesis (converting RTL design into gate-level representation).


**📘 Key Terms**

-Design → The main Verilog code/module that implements the required logic or digital circuit (e.g., adder, counter, FSM).

-Testbench → A separate Verilog file written to test the design. It applies input stimulus, monitors outputs, and verifies that the design works correctly. The testbench is not synthesized, it is only for simulation.



**Lab Session 1 – Activities and Commands**

1. Virtual Machine Setup
   
⦁	Opened the VM for the RTL workshop.

⦁	Cloned the workshop repository:

git clone (https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git)

Navigated into the library:

cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop

cd my_lib

ls -- # Viewing all .lib files used for synthesis 




2.Verilog Simulation with iVerilog

⦁	Navigated to Verilog files folder:

cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop

cd verilog_files/



Compiled RTL and testbench:

iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v 

Checked compiled output: ls 
./a.out 


Opened GTKWave to view waveform:

gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd → opens waveform for verification.


Comments:
⦁	iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v → compiles design and testbench.

⦁	gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd 





3. RTL Synthesis with Yosys
   
⦁	Invoked Yosys:
yosys


Steps in Yosys workflow:

1.Read Liberty file (standard cell info for synthesis):
read_liberty -lib path/to/.lib file


2.Read Verilog design:
read_verilog path/to/design.v_file


3.Perform synthesis (synth - top module):
synth -top <module_name> 


4.Generate netlist using ABC:
abc -liberty path/to/.lib file


5.Analyze and show results:
show 


6.Yosys write_verilog options

Default command:
write_verilog good_mux_netlist.v

→ Generates the full netlist of your design.

→Can be very “heavy” because it includes all synthesis attributes and extra metadata.


With -noattr option:

write_verilog -noattr good_mux_netlist.v 

→ The -noattr option removes all synthesis attributes from the netlist.

→Generates a cleaner, simpler netlist with just the logic structure (modules, wires, gates).

→Useful if you want a lightweight netlist without extra metadata.


 
**Comments:**
⦁	read_liberty → Loads standard cell library for synthesis.

⦁	read_verilog → Loads the design RTL.

⦁	synth -top → Synthesizes the design module.

⦁	abc -liberty → Maps design to technology cells.

⦁	write_verilog → Generates the full Verilog netlist of the design.

⦁	write_verilog -attr → Generates netlist keeping important synthesis attributes.

⦁	write_verilog -noattr → Generates a clean netlist with no synthesis attributes.

⦁	show → Visualizes netlist or synthesis results graphically.
