- Reduces **flip-flops, logic gates, and power consumption**.  
- Commonly applied to **counters and FSMs**.  

### ðŸ”¹ c. Cloning and Re-timing
- **Cloning**: replicating logic paths to balance timing or reduce critical path delay.  
- **Re-timing**: moving flip-flops across combinational logic to optimize **clock period** and timing closure.  
- Both improve **performance and timing** of sequential circuits.  

### ðŸ”¹ d. Combinational Logic Optimization
- Reduce Boolean expressions to minimize **area and power**.
